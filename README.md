# odin-recipes

Currently im setting up my git repo and im making a programming project on HTML and GitHub. I have to create a webpage that consists of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website isnt using CSS so it wont look the best.

This is practice on using HTML and seeing what ive learned so far
