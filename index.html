        Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to learn how to make a perfect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!
       </p>

       <h4>Ingredient List for Smoked Salmon Sushi Roll</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
            <li>8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>
            <li>1 cucumber, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
        </ul>
    <!-- List of ingredients neeeded for recipe -->
        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>
            <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
            <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</li>
            <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Here is the website for the recipe on the smash burgers. https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8489146/homemade-smash-burgers/  -->
        <p>
            This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!
        </p>

        <h4>Ingredient list for Homemade Smash Burgers</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
            <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- List of ingredients for recipe -->

        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
            <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
            <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tips</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>If you only have one spatula, wrap your other hand in an old dish towel for protection, and use it to press down on the spatula with both hands.</li>
            <li>You can make 4 (4 ounce) patties instead of 8 (2 ounce patties), but I prefer the thinner patties that have more crispy surface area.</li>
            <li>I buy American cheese freshly-sliced from the deli, but individually-wrapped slices will work too.</li>
        </ul>

            This sweet coleslaw recipe tastes like the slaw served at popular fried chicken or fish restaurants. It's excellent with burgers or on top of BBQ pork sandwiches, too!

            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon poppy seeds</li>

            The best tacos! A soft shell taco is layered with refried beans, then wrapped around a hard shell taco, which is filled with seasoned ground beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and fresh guacamole. You can top it with whatever you like, but I recommend loading it up! Also, if you don't eat meat, put melted cheese on the soft shell, and the refried beans in the hard.
        </p>

        <h4>Ingredient list for Double Decker Taco's</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li>⅔ cup water</li>
            <li>12 prepared crisp taco shells</li>
            <li>2 avocados</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
            <li>1 fresh lime, juiced</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>12 (7 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
            <li>¼ red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>


        <ol>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and sprinkle about 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning over the meat. Cook and stir the ground beef, breaking it up as it cooks, until the beef is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.</li>
            <li>Mash the refried beans with the water in a small saucepan, and sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning packet. Heat the refried beans over low heat until simmering.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the crisp taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste, and set aside.</li>
            <li>To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2 tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap the tortilla gently around a crisp tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground beef along the bottom of the crisp shell, and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Top the cheese with shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion, and a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.</li>
        </ol>
